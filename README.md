# Stacks and Queues in C++

This repository delves into the fundamentals of stacks and queues in C++. It provides clear explanations, code examples, and curated practice problems from LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks to help you master these essential data structures.

# Sections:

## Introduction :

Define Stacks (LIFO - Last In, First Out): data structures where elements are added and removed from the top (think of a stack of plates).

Define Queues (FIFO - First In, First Out): data structures where elements are added at the back and removed from the front (think of a waiting line).

Explain their applications (undo/redo functionality, task scheduling, etc.).

## Implementation :

Explore two common implementation approaches:

Array-based: Efficient for accessing elements but has limitations on size (consider potential overflow/underflow).

Linked List-based: Dynamically adjusts size but may have slightly slower access times.

Provide code examples for creating, pushing/enqueueing, popping/dequeueing elements, and checking for emptiness using both approaches.

## Operations :

Demonstrate common stack and queue operations:

Stack: push, pop, top (returns the top element without removal)

Queue: enqueue, dequeue, front (returns the front element without removal)

Emphasize the LIFO and FIFO principles for each data structure.
